2 years ago, I wrote my first C# game. The idea of the 
game was simple: we have Money, Power and Energy. 
Earning Money - we are deprived of Strength and Energy. 
Replenishing the Force - we are losing Energy, and 
replenishing Energy - money. The player played when he 
had one of these ends.

I believe that this "game", to some extent, is the 
first version of my game called "", since they have the 
same idea, only implemented differently.

The first version of the code was terrible because I 
didn't know much about programming at the time. Looking 
at him after a while, I saw the bunch of mistakes that 
I made. So I decided, based on my knowledge gained over 
the past 2 years, to rewrite this code.

In general, the purpose of creating this game is to test 
yourself. Therefore, this game, to some extent, shows how 
much I have grown in writing code.

Of course, it is possible that in this code, I made a 
trillion mistakes. Maybe after a while, I will look at him 
and say something like: "God, what is this?". But so far, 
everything suits me.
